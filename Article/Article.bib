	initially higher values at inland locations at high elevations. As
	a result crude protein was positively correlated with altitude and

	indicate that this pattern is quite general and probably constitutional.
	These findings suggest that the species composition of the zooplankton

	the spatial distribution and diet composition of ungulates is influenced

	diet type and diet quality with body mass and hypsodonty, two morphological
	features that have been associated with both elements. 2. We use
	stable carbon isotope ratios of faeces to reconstruct diet in terms
	of proportions of C-3 plants (browse) and C-4 plants (grass) consumed
	by different species in different seasons. These data are combined
	with proxies for diet quality (per cent nitrogen, neutral detergent
	fibre, acid detergent fibre, and acid detergent lignin) from faeces
	to track changes in diet quality. 3. Two statistical approaches are
	used in model selection, i.e. tests of significant correlations based
	on linear regression analyses, and an information-theory approach
	(Akaike's Information Criterion) providing insight into strength
	of evidence for models. 4. Results of both methods show that, contrary
	to many predictions, body mass and diet type are not related, but
	these data confirm predictions that diet quality decreases with increasing
	body size, especially during the dry season. Hypsodonty, as expected,
	varies with diet type, increasing with increased grass intake. 5.
	These findings support both a diet type and diet quality model, implying
	some degree of exclusivity. We propose that congruence between models
	may be achieved through addition of diet quality proxies not included
	here, because hypsodonty is more likely a reflection of the abrasive
	properties of consumed foods, i.e. related to food quality, rather
	than food type. This implies that adaptation to diets of varying
	quality, through changes in body size and dental features, has been
	the primary mechanism for diversification in ungulates. 6. Our interpretation
	contrasts with several recent studies advocating diet type as the
	primary factor, exemplifying that further reconciliation between
	the two models is needed. We discuss the implications of this study
	for future approaches to achieve a more cohesive understanding of
	the evolutionary outcomes of herbivore nutrition.}

	Red Deer eat a varied diet comprising at least 145 plant species.
	The main sources of diet variation were due to habitat, leading us
	to identify three habitat types characterized by the consumption

	for the seed and fruit items which were used mainly during the hunting
	season. Our results confirm that Red Deer can be classified among

	to be primarily a concentrate feeder (max. 75%) with no significant
	seasonal variation between the quantities of grass or sedges and
	concentrate food in the diet. In the light of these results, we discuss

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is considered, except for sodium, to be the most limiting
	mineral for growth and reproduction in large mammalian herbivores
	worldwide and a predictor of ungulate distribution and abundance.
	Knowledge of phosphorus nutrition and seasonal adaptation to dynamics
	in mineral needs and availability in wild herbivores is incomplete.
	This paper reports data on experiments designed to evaluate physiological
	responses to low dietary P and to determine phosphorus requirements
	in male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a browsing cervid
	with presumed elevated mineral requirements during antlerogenesis.
	Adult (greater-than-or-equal-to 2 yr) male deer were housed individually
	and placed on three levels of dietary P (0.14-0.19%, 0.24-0.27%,
	and 0.34-0.36% of diet dry mass) from June 1989 to September 1991.
	We conducted balance trials to measure seasonal P retention and to
	model annual and seasonal dietary P requirements. Data were collected
	on serum chemistry, endocrine function, antler growth, antler composition,
	and tail bone composition in two trials designed to test the hypothesis
	that P is limiting to deer antler growth in southwestern habitats.
	Phosphorus balance varied by diet and tended to fluctuate seasonally.
	Retention was highest for the 0.19% P diet and greatest during the
	fall. The variation in P balance resulted from increased efficiency
	in P metabolism in animals on the 0.14-0.19% P diet. Dietary phosphorus
	requirements were estimated at 72.2 mg.kg-0.75.d-1 (0.14% P at study
	intake rates) on an annual basis, changing seasonally from 94.4 mg.kg-0.75.d-1
	(0.16%) during spring to 57.4 mg.kg-0.75.d-1 (0.11%), and 59.6 mg.kg-0.75.d-1
	(0.12%) during summer and fall, respectively. Feed consumption, body
	mass, antler size and composition, and bone composition did not vary
	by diet. Diet x month interactions were observed in 1990 and 1991
	for serum activity of alkaline phosphatase (AP), manifested in higher
	activity on the 0.14-0.19% P diet during the peak period of antler
	growth. Changes in AP were an indicator of physiological compensation
	to low dietary P. Other key serum chemistries and hormonal concentrations
	did not vary by diet. These results suggest that P limitation for
	antler growth is unlikely for adult browsing cervids. We predict
	sensitivity of the distribution and abundance of male cervids to
	P limitation to be a function of feeding strategy and body size.}

	It is especially interesting that members of the dominating herbivores

	high P:C ratios. Sestonic P:C ratios in epilimnetic waters are usually
	far below that encountered in the zooplankton, which suggests that
	grazers may approach a direct phosphorus limitation in many localities.
	This view was supported by a regional study of 47 lakes, in which
	most independent variables including phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll
	were scarcely correlated with zooplankton biomass but particulate
	P (>0.45 mum) could explain a major part of the variance of zooplankton
	biomass. Of the various taxa, daphnids gave the best correlation
	with particulate P, cyclopids and rotifers the worst. These observations
	suggest that phytoplankton biomass per se may not be the major determinant
	of zooplankton biomass but that the nutritional status of phytoplankton
	(P cell quotas) rather than biomass in terms of carbon is most important,
	or that zooplankton suffer a direct P limitation in many lakes. The
	latter view is supported by model predictions given in this article.
	Also, both freshwater and marine copepod grazers could correspondingly
	be growth limited by an N:C ratio of ingested food that is too low.
	The possibility of direct nutrient element limitation has wide implications

	we found distinct diel fluctuation in soil water potential (psi(S)),

	following day. These fluctuations in psi(S), are consistent with
	other observations of HL and in A tortilis were found up to 10 in
	from the tree. In 2000, during a severe drought, fs measurements
	indicated that HL was largely absent. The finding that HL occurred
	in wetter years and not in drier years was supported by data obtained
	on the 5180 values in soil, rain and groundwater. The 6180 of water
	extracted from the xylem water of grasses indicated that when they
	grew near trees they had values similar to those of groundwater.
	This could be because they either (1) use water from deeper soil
	layers or (2) use hydraulically lifted water provided by the tree;
	this was not seen in the same grass species growing outside tree
	canopies. While our data indicate that HL indeed occurs under Acacia
	trees, it is also true that psi(S) was consistently lower under trees
	when compared to outside tree canopies. We believe that this is because
	tree-grass mixtures take up more water from the upper soil layers
	than is exuded by the tree each night. This limits the beneficial
	effect of HL for understorey grasses and suggests that in savannas
	both facilitation via HL and competition are active processes. The

	body size in many ecosystems. There are two major hypotheses to explain
	their co-existence, but few comparative data are available to test
	them. The first postulates that the very different functioning of
	their digestive tracts leads to fundamentally different patterns
	of use of grasses of different fibre contents. The second postulates
	resource partitioning through the use of different plant species.
	As domestic horses and cattle are used widely in Europe for the management
	of conservation areas, particularly in wetlands, a good knowledge
	of their foraging behaviour and comparative nutrition is necessary.
	2. In this paper we describe resource-use by horses and cattle in
	complementary studies in two French wetlands. Horses used marshes
	intensively during the warmer seasons. both species used grasslands
	intensively throughout the year; cattle used forbs and shrubs much
	more than horses. Niche breadth was similar and overlap was high
	(Kulczinski's index 0.58-0.77). Horses spent much more time feeding
	on short grass than cattle. These results from the two sites indicate
	strong potential for competition. 3. Comparative daily food intake.
	measured in the field during this study for the first time, was 63%
	higher in horses (144 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)) than in cattle (88
	g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)). Digestibility of the cattle diets was a
	little higher. but daily intake of digestible dry matter (i.e. nutrient
	extraction) in all seasons was considerably higher in horses (78
	g(DM) kg W-0.75 day (-1)) than in cattle (51 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)).
	When food is limiting. horses should outcompete cattle in habitats
	dominated by grasses because their functional response is steeper:
	under these circumstances cattle will require an ecological refuge
	for survival during winter, woodland or shrubland with abundant dicotyledons.
	4. Horses are a good tool for plant management because they remove
	more vegetation per unit body weight than cattle. and use the most

  abstract = {Costs of locomotion are frequently ignored in models determining the
	optimal diet of free-ranging ungulates. In order to determine whether
	such omissions are justified, the relationship between bite size
	and distance travelled per day is investigated in several wild species
	of ruminant grazing natural pastures in the Serengeti National Park,
	Tanzania. (2) The distance travelled to obtain a gram of food rises
	exponentially as bite size declines. Animals feeding on short swards
	have small bite sizes, but it is suggested that animals feeding selectively
	on course grasslands would also have small bite sizes. It is shown
	that the heat production in locomotion of selective animals can form
	a large fraction of the daily intake of metabolizable energy. (3)
	A simple model of the energy exchange in free-ranging ruminants is
	developed incorporating parameters of diet quality and heat production.
	The model applies to pastures which do not set a limit to the daily
	intake of dry matter. The optimum level of selection for high quality
	constituents in the grass sward is found by determining the conditions
	in which energy retention (net energy) is at a maximum. (4) For any
	particular pasture, the optimum level of selection is found to be
	strongly dependent on the cost of locomotion per day and on the difference
	between the metabolizable energy concentration of high and low quality
	constituents, weakly dependent on the average quality of forage,
	and independent of the ruminant's resting metabolic rate. (5) The
	model predicts that the optimum level of selection by large grazing
	herbivores will be lower than that of smaller animals. This is because
	large herbivores gain more from digesting low quality constituents
	due to their ability to digest cell walls, and also because the foraging
	costs of large animals are higher.}

  abstract = {The theoretical description of exploitation competition, known as
	resource competition theory (RCT) or resource-ratio theory, has been
	tested in terrestrial plant communities and microorganisms in laboratory
	cultures. Applications in animal ecology have been rare, although
	the theory itself is generic. A major difficulty is that the description
	of resources in RCT is fundamentally different from that used in
	classical studies of animal competition. In presenting the first
	fully specified RCT models for terrestrial animals, we distinguish
	between positive attributes (mineral elements) and negative attributes
	(plant defenses) as indicators of quality in animal resources. Using
	the latter we apply RCT to ungulate communities that exploit just
	two resources: the cell wall and cell contents of plant material.
	We show how coexistence in the same habitats depends on the strategy
	of resource exploitation. Ungulate species that differ in body size
	adopt a "demand-minimizing" strategy that permits them to coexist
	on ratios of the two resources by acquiring less of the resource
	that most limits their competitor. Ungulates that differ in mouth
	width adopt an "extraction-maximizing" strategy that leads to competitive
	exclusion because they acquire more of the resource that most limits
	their competitor. We conclude that differential resource utilization
	permits grazing herbivores of different body size to coexist on the
	same grassland habitats, but that the full diversity of grazing communities
	depends on spatial heterogeneity in plant defenses at the landscape
	level.}

	approach enables a clear description to be made of the trade-offs
	reached by animals in regulating their nutritional balance. Animals
	given a nutritionally balanced food, or two or more imbalanced but
	complementary foods, can satisfy their nutrient requirements. However,

  abstract = {In African savannahs, large trees improve grass quality, particularly
	in dry and nutrient poor areas. Enhanced below-canopy grass nutrients,
	such as nitrogen and phosphorus contents should therefore attract
	and benefit grazers. To predict whether ungulates really need these
	forage quality islands we focused oil four grazer species, i.e.,
	zebra, buffalo, wildebeest, and warthog, differing in body size and
	digestive system. We confronted literature estimations of their feeding
	requirements with forage availability and quality, observed in three
	South African savannah systems., through linear modelling. The model
	predicted the proportion of below-canopy grass that grazers should
	include in their diet to meet their nutritional requirements. During
	the wet season, the model predicted that all animals could satisfy
	their daily nutrient requirements when feeding on a combination of
	below- and outside-canopy grasses. However, wildebeest, having relatively
	high nutrient demands, Could meet their nutrient requirements only
	by feeding almost exclusively below canopies. During the dry season,
	all animals could gain almost twice as much digestible protein when
	feeding oil below compared to outside-canopy forage. Nonetheless,
	only warthogs could satisfy their nutrient requirements - when feeding
	almost exclusively oil below-canopy grasses. The other ungulate species
	Could not meet their phosphorus demands by feeding at either site
	Without exceeding their maximum fibre intake, indicating the unfavourable
	conditions during the dry season. We conclude that grazing ungulates,
	particularly warthog, zebra, and buffalo, actually depend on the
	available below-canopy grass resources. Our model therefore helps
	to quantify the importance of higher quality forage patches beneath
	savannah trees. The composition of grazer communities depending on
	below-canopy grasses call be anticipated if grazer food requirements
	and the abundance of large trees in savannahs are known. The model
	suggests that the conservation of large single-standing trees ill
	savannahs is crucial for maintenance of locally grazing herbivores.
